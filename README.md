# 19-PWA-Text-Editor

## Description
This website is for developers to create notes of code and the website can be used with or without the internet. The user will be able to access their notes anytime.

## Usage
When the user opens the application you will see a client server and be able to run "npm run start" from the root directory. When you find the application it will start up the backend for the client. The user will notice that the javascript files will be bundled using webpack and when you run the plugins, you will get a generated html file, service worker and manifest file. Once the files are there, you can open text editor and you will see that the indexDB has created a storage for your database. If you click off the DOM window you will find that the content you added in text editor has been saved with your indexedDB. You can then reopen the content in text editor and all your content will be retrieved. You can also install and download your web application as an icon on your desktop. When you load the application you should have a registered service worker using workbox. Lastly you can deploy to Heroku and have scripts for a webpack application.
